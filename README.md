What would the Big O be of inserting a new EDGE to:
An Edge List?         O(n) append array
An Adjacency Matrix?  O(1) at position
An Adjacency List?    O(1) array & linked list

What would the Big O be of inserting a new VERTEX to:
An Edge List?         O(n)  append array
An Adjacency Matrix?  O(n^2) append 2D array
An Adjacency List?    O(n)  append array

What would the Big O be of REMOVING a vertex or edge from:
An Edge List?         O(n)
An Adjacency Matrix?  O(n^2)
An Adjacency List?    O(n)
